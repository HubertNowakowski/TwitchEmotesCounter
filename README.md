# TwitchEmotesCounter

This is a simple program written in Python 3.6.2.

It was created as an excercise to test knowledge I accuaried during my university studies.
I'm not proficient with this language so please point out any errors I might have made.

The program connects with twitchemotes API (https://twitchemotes.com/) and searches for specified channel name.
The user has to provide start and end point for emote counting.
Results will be printed on screen in form of a table.
The program is also able to save data into XLS file.

In the future I plan to add data analisys using pandas library and maybe GUI.
